  1. Implementation of Optimized Hardware Architecture of Lightweight Block Ciphers in FPGA                                                                                   
    • Successfully designed and implemented various optimized hardware architectures of RECTANGLE, PRESENT, ESF and QTL lightweight ciphers in FPGA. Implemented BRAM based design and reduced datapath designs as well. Used Xilinx ISE design suite 13.6 with HDL language as Verilog for implementation. Performed power analysis using XPower analyzer. Implemented and evaluated designs in various platforms like Virtex-5, Virtex-4, Spartan-6, Spartan-3E on the basis of resource utilization, power consumption and performance.
