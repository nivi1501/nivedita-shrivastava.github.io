You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/nivi1501/nivi1501.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub will automatically rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files, that means - your .md file gets converted to html.

# How to add content to this blog?

1. Create a <pagename>.md file with the contents that you want in markdown format  
2. Now, the html page that will be created using the file created in step 1 will be <your_repository_name.github.io/pagename.html>
3. You can interlink the pages. See this example in markdown. Here ```[link](https://nivi1501.github.io/pagename.html)```
